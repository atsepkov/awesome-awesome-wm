# Awesome Awesome WM [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> A curated list of high-quality tools/scripts/configs for Awesome Window Manager.

This guide was created because an out-of-the-box Awesome WM experience is miserable, yet the WM quickly grows on those courageous enough to tinker with it and weather version-incompatibility issues. This guide was created for those who need a head start with their awesome config.

One problem with Awesome WM is that newer versions of Awesome break a lot of backwards compatibility. Many of the below libraries have been updated to Awesome 4.2, ones that haven't will not work with the latest version of Awesome. A library written for Awesome 3.5 will not work with Awesome 4.0 and one written for 3.4 will not work with either so make sure the versions between your modules match. This in itself creates a lot of frustration for users and a segmentation of Awesome user base.

This repository tries to keep up to date, most of the tools listed here are compatible with Awesome 4.0+, some 3.4-3.5 tools are listed if they're notable due to their use case or compatible with current version of Awesome.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.

- [Menu Replacement](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-freedesktop) - Unlike default menu that looks very basic compared to other window managers, this menu replaces the original with a more `Start`-like menu with icons.

## Wanted
- Widgets for CPU monitoring, polished mail integration.
- Audio/MPD integration that's not overly complex like AwsoMPD (which is somewhat bloated and buggy).
- More theme bundles to share (if you want to share your theme, I ask that you attach a screenshot to your repo).
